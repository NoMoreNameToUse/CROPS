# CROPS
A Cylindrical Remote Operated Planting System

The CROPS project is a primitive approach of a possible remote planting system based on cylindrical coordinates and is intended to act as a demonstration for a CNC machine based on a cylindrical coordinate system, as well as the possibility of sowing, supervising and harvesting plants from a distance.

# Objectives of the project
Basic
- Remote planting, tending and harvesting of the grain
- Environment monitoring
- Create a controllable environment for plants 

With possibilities
- Automatic pouring, documenting and harvesting using Opencv, Tensorflow etc.
